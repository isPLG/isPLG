Product-led growth (PLG) is a go-to-market (GTM) strategy where you focus on delivering value via your product with low barriers to entry. This usually involves a self-serve aspect in the product with a synchronized sales-assist motion (if applicable) that employs the consultative sales approach - commonly known as product led sales. 

On the other hand, functions like Marketing have evolved to be a growth engine in this motion by focusing on product focused content distributed via various channels. The goals here is to drive acquisition or product usage. Another key strategy here that Marketing may drive in collaboration with product is Community Led growth. 

Traditional B2B sales motions that focused on lead gen and a sales led approach are still applicable in some use-cases or segments but are increasingly on the decline. 

Now all of this is table stakes and we know it. Great PLG companies also focus on creating or re-inventing the flow. More on this later.

## PLG in action

At it’s core, PLG is all about optimizing the customer journey from value promise & delivery. This includes pricing and packing your features in way that there is concrete value and a clear path from Free/Freemium to Paid to Enterprise (if applicable).

### Value Promise

Your product’s value promise starts before your users visit your website. This can be done by use case and product focused content. You clearly outline your product’s value proposition in context of your customer problems and drive them to your marketing website.

Marketing & community led growth efforts focused on specific channels drive prospects to your website where you reinforce the value promise and offer pathways to convert to the product or talk to Sales. Success is measured by conversion rates to your self-serve product. Understanding the channels and content consumption habits of your users on your web properties and campaigns can also help you personalize the product experience once a user signs up.

You can start with experimenting with new & existing growth engines here like paid marketing, SEO, social, etc to drive user acquisition. Traditional marketing tactics like Demand Gen can also be evolved to drive users to the product apart from lead gen.

### Value Delivery

This part of the customer journey post signup is where you guide your users from the Setup to the Aha! moment — where they have experienced the value proposition of the product. Use case and customer segments are the two common dimensions that you can use to personalize your in-product experience. The easiest way to get this information is via on-boarding questionnaire, however you can also infer this data via third party tools or use information from content & campaigns that are driving acquisition to your product.

Focusing on use cases helps putting things in context of the problems your users face. However, the most important benefit use case based onboarding and activation is the ordering of features that you enable your users to discover. The same is true with segmentation of your user base as well. Features around security might be more relevant to your enterprise segment v/s startups.
