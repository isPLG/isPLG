The product-led growth concepts are so easy to understand but hard to implement. We strongly believe that PLG is a strong customer-centric GTM strategy and implement these concepts in our daily work (or at least try to). isPLG is an effort to share best practices and specifically tie concepts to practical applications. 

Secondly, we want to talk to the practitioners in the community and get tips/tricks that we all can try for ourselves. We have a few folks in our network that we will request to come over and share their expertise over the coming weeks. And if you have any suggestions, please contact [me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandhua) or [Vivek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vasinha/).

## Format

We have chosen Podcasts as the preferred medium of content delivery, and we also aim to write an accompanying blog post. Conversational podcasts are a great medium to spark intellectually stimulating conversations. 

## Content

From a traditional point of view, we will be discussing various topics that touch product development & growth marketing. We may dangerously tread into the Sales world at times in order to cover all aspects of your GTM strategy. 

From a structural perspective, we will cover various parts of the customer journey and use the Racecar framework to discuss growth. At times though, we may just add some of our musings around data, product ideas, etc to spark conversation.
