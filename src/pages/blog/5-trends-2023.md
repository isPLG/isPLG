Stay ahead of the curve in 2023 with these top trends for founders and CEOs. From prioritizing Product Led Sales to revamping pricing and packaging strategies, these tips will help your company thrive in a competitive market. Don't forget to focus on customer flow and SEO, and remember that the key to success is balancing innovation with a commitment to users. Stay on top of these trends to drive concrete growth and improve retention in the coming year.

1. Companies will go heavy on **Product Led Sales (PLS)** to attract Enterprise deals. With the recession looming or already here, organizations are under extreme pressure to deliver concrete growth. However, be extremely careful and do not ignore your self-serve customer base.
    - Some organizations will start treating their self-serve channels as another lead generation source. This shift might lead to your sales team reaching out to various segments of your self-serve user base before they have had a chance to experience your product. This behavior will lead to a sub-par user experience for your customers.
    - Elena Verna has a [good framework](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/elenaverna_growth-b2b-plg-activity-7016409922565210114-jbkN?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) to think about PLS which we recommend checking out.

2. Product teams will focus on developing new **features for the enterprise** to support the PLS motion. This is great because some of these features may be applicable to small to mid sized companies as well. 

    - However, do not forget to create awesome features for your self-serve customer base as well. If history has taught us anything, it is that during recessions, a lot of startups are born and attracting them early on will set you up for long-term success. Note: If startups use your product, you are cool. ðŸ˜Ž
   
3. **Pricing & Packaging** will become extremely important in 2023. Teams will start looking to generate more money by gating free features. We advise that you focus on the customer by creating packages that deliver concrete value as they progress to higher-tier plans. Your free plan should deliver immense value upfront so that the upgrade to paid is a compelling no-brainer.

   - Gating critical features that are indispensable to your customer workflow would be a mistake. If you start from the customer & their workflow, it will be much easier to gauge which features to gate and when.

4. **SEO** will become a top priority in 2023. As companies tighten spending, they will look for ways to generate content loops that are sustainable in the long run. This will also increase focus on community-generated content with bonus points where it is generated as the part of the product flow.

   - Focus on quality v/s quantity.

5. Great PLG companies will focus their efforts on building **the flow** in their product â€” and for this to happen, they will have to start from the customer v/s the feature. Product teams will engage in understanding the flow of the user and designing not just features but also experiences that vastly improve or automate that flow.

   - Initiatives like these will improve the key metric of Retention thereby improving monetization.
